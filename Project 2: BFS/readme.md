ENPM 661 Project 2

To run the file bfs_point.py, open Spyder with Python 3.7 and OpenCV 4.1.0.
Press F5 or the play button, and proceed to enter the start coordinate with numbers. No comma is needed, just 2 numbers separated with a space.
If the coordinate is not in an obstacle and is inside the workspace (400 h x300 w) then it is fine.
The program will then prompt you for a goal coordinate. Similar to above once you input a goal the program will then show in the console its checks for the children nodes. When the goal is found the program outputs the parent list and the path traveled.
A video called BFS.avi will be saved when the program is done running.
