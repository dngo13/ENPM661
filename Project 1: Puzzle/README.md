**ENPM 661 Project 1: 15 Puzzle** 

Diane Ngo
**Objective**
The objective of this project is to code a 15 Puzzle in Python.
The libraries used are: numpy, copy, and time. Numpy is used for all matrix operations. Copy is used for deep copying a node and saving it to another variable with all changes kept. Time is used to keep track of how long the program takes to operate.
The project consists of proj1_diane_ngo.py, which is the file used to run the project.

To open this project, import the _proj1_diane_ngo.py_ file into an IDE such as PyCharm or Spyder, and then run the program using Python 3.8.
Alternatively, you can run python proj1_diane_ngo.py in terminal when in the base directory. 
To change the test case in the program, you must comment out the **first** node_state_i and then copy one of the test cases into the **second** node_state_i. 
All 5 of the test cases are formatted properly so that it can be copy pasted into the variable with no issue.
The file nodePath.py is the output file generated by the program, consisting of the state of the node from initial to goal.
